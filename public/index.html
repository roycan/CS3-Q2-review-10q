    <h2> Friendly reminder</h2>
    <p>As a Philippine Science High School scholar, 
        please subscribe to the core values of INTEGRITY, EXCELLENCE, SERVICE as best as you can, guided by my conscience and abilty.  
        AVOID sharing answers with others (electronically or through other forms), 
        instead teach the lessons in a way that others figure out the answer on their own and benefit from it more. 
        Please report suspected violations of academic dishonesty so we can all improve. 
        While understanding that ANY FORM OF ACADEMIC DISHONESTY may lead to DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS.</p>
